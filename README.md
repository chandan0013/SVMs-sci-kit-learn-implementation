# SVMs-sci-kit-learn-implementation
Hyper-parameter 'C' tuning using linear kernel 

Fashion MNIST data (https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).
There is a fixed training and testing set. From training data, use first 80 percent for training"
and last 20 percent as validation data".
Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes: 0 T-
shirt/top, 1 Trouser, 2 Pullover, 3 Dress, 4 Coat, 5 Sandal, 6 Shirt, 7 Sneaker, 8 Bag, 9 Ankle
boot.
You will use ONLY training data for training and testing data for evaluation.

1. Select the best value of C for linear kernel based on validation/testing accuracy
2. Compute the Confusion matrix
3. Based on value of Q1, plot accuracy curve for polynomial kernels
